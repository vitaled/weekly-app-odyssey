# Introducing Weekly App Odyssey: A Copilot-Guided Coding Marathon

## What is this?

This is a repository of the code I wrote for the [Weekly App Odyssey](https://medium.com/@vitaled/introducing-weekly-app-odyssey-a-copilot-guided-coding-marathon-72af1b8eca6c) series on Medium. The series is a coding marathon where I build a new app every week, with the help of GitHub Copilot.

## What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that helps you write code faster and with less effort. It is powered by OpenAI Codex, a new AI system created by OpenAI. You can read more about it [here](https://copilot.github.com/).

## What is the goal of this series?

The goal of this series is to explore the capabilities of GitHub Copilot and see how it can help developers build apps faster. I will be building a new app every week, and I will be using GitHub Copilot to help me write the code.

## What kind of apps will you be building?

I will be building apps that are useful to me, and that I think will be useful to other developers. Given I'm an experienced developer on backend services and data engineering, I will put my focus on building apps that are not related to these areas and that challenge me 
so that I can test the effectivness of the Copilot.

I will also try to build apps that are not too complex, so that I can build them in a week.

## What is the schedule for this series?

I will be building a new app every week, and I will be publishing a new article every week. The schedule for the series is as follows:
